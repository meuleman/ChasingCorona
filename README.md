### Expressing COVID-19 infection cases as a percentage of the population

I was interested in seeing what percentage of the population is (confirmed to be) affected by the COVID-19 coronavirus,
so I downloaded data on confirmed cases and normalized with per-country population estimates.

Figure gets updated daily as long as data remain available (h/t @JHUSystems).\

**DISCLAIMER**: I am not a virologist or epidemiologist â€“ I realize there are many caveats to interpreting these data.\
We do not nearly have enough data to make precise estimates, in particular because of the relatively small number of tests performed in most countries.

### Additional figures
The following figures are even harder to interpret than the one shown above.
That said, for the sake of completeness I include them here.

![perc. of population death or recovered](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meuleman/ChasingCorona/master/percentage_population_deaths_recovered_top9_min50_latest.png "% of per-country population that has died or recovered from COVID-19")
