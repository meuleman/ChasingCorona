### Additional figures
The following figures are even harder to interpret than the one shown above.
Many factors play a role here -- for instance the number of tests performed -- and their influence is hard to overestimate.
That said, for the sake of completeness I include them here.

![perc. of population death or recovered](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meuleman/ChasingCorona/master/percentage_population_deaths_recovered_top9_min50_latest.png "% of per-country population that has died or recovered from COVID-19")

![perc. of cases death or recovered](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meuleman/ChasingCorona/master/percentage_cases_deaths_recovered_top9_min50_latest.png "% of per-country cases that has died or recovered from COVID-19")
